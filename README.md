# Anomaly Detection using Variational Autoencoder LSTM

***Authors: Jonas SÃ¸bro Christophersen & Lau Johansson*** <br /> <br />


This repository contains hand-in assignment for the DTU course 02460 Advanced Machine Learning. 

This notebook is a implementation of a variational autoencoder which can detect anomalies unsupervised.

It is inspired by the approach proposed by J. Pereira and M. Silveira in paper "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Energy Time Series Data Using Variational Recurrent Autoencoders with Attention". Find it [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614232)

The code has taken inspiration in [Pytorch's VAE example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/vae/main.py)
