# AnomalyDetection_VariationalAutoencoderLSTM
This notebook is a implementation of a variational autoencoder with can detect anomalies unspuervised.

It is inspired by the approach proposed by J. Pereira and M. Silveira in paper "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Energy Time Series Data Using Variational Recurrent Autoencoders with Attention"
